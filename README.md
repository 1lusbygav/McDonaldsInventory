# McDonaldsInventory

# Written by: Gavin, Isaac, Katie
# Date: May 12-June 10, 2022
# Purpose: Create a comprehensive inventory software for McDonald's employees and managers to use

# GENERAL PROGRAMMING NOTES
# - subdivs.csv does not get modified by the program. It should only be edited manually when adding new products.
# - Some changes were committed in-meet or commits weren't made so they don't show up on the Github commit/push history, so we left a few 'edited by' header comments (Gavin and Katie mostly committed/pushed so those edits will show up on Github so putting them here in Replit comments is unnecessary)
# M333r is Gavin(on the github I made some commits from the wrong account)
