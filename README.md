# Written by: Gavin, Isaac, Katie

# Purpose: Create a comprehensive inventory software for McDonald's employees and managers to use

# GENERAL PROGRAMMING NOTES

# --> subdivs.csv does not get modified by the program. It should only be edited manually when adding new products.

# --> Some changes were committed in-meet or commits weren't made so they don't show up on the Github commit/push history, so we left a few 'edited by' header comments (Gavin and Katie mostly committed/pushed so those edits will show up on Github so we thought putting them here in Replit comments again would be unnecessary)

# --> M333r is Gavin (on the GitHub he made some commits from the wrong account)
